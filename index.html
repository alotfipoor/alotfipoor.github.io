        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Ashkan Lotfipoor</strong>. I’m an <strong>Engineering Geology</strong> graduate from the University of Tehran who works as a <strong>Data Analyst</strong> for Samsung electronics in <strong>Iran</strong>. Currently, I’m looking for opportunities to continue my education as a PhD student.</p>
        <p>For my master thesis, I used a number of <strong>Machine Learning</strong> algorithms to develop a new method for estimating the impacts of tunneling on springs discharge rate. At the same time, I worked at <strong>Samsung Electronics</strong> as a Data Analyst. During this period, I found a new appreciation for using data to solve complex problems and for this reason, I’m eager to learn more in this path and to use the techniques that I’ve learned to uncover new grounds in science.</p>
        <p>Thus, my <strong>research interests</strong> lie primarily in an area between Engineering Geology and Data Science. There are many problems that can be tackled with this new approach, such as the estimation of various soil and rock properties (e.g. ground bearing capacity estimation), environmental impact assessment of civil projects, performance predictions of TBM, Landslide risk analysis and Early Warning Systems. So, right now my research interest is to combine my growing knowledge of Data Science and Engineering Geology to solve complex problems by mining and modeling the data streams from different sources.</p>
        <p>My training has laid the foundations for these goals. I studied engineering geology under the supervisions of Dr. Jafar Hassanpour and Dr. Akbar Cheshomi in the University of Tehran. During my studies, due to my excellent grades, I was Ranked 1st among my fellow classmates. My thesis was about developing a new methodology for estimating the risk of spring drawdown by using data from tunneling Mega-projects in Iran. In order to achieve this goal, tunneling data from six long water conveyance tunnels were Collected and analyzed.</p>
        <p>Performance of various Machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.) were evaluated and the best approach was selected. Besides, a new program for probabilistic analysis of water inflow into tunnels was written using VBA language. The results of this study can be found in papers that I’ve published so far in different conferences. I also have a paper under review in Tunneling and Underground Space Technology which will be published in a couple of months. I could also send the manuscript for your consideration.</p>

        <h2>My Journey towards Data Science</h2>
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, I became familiar with Data Science and Machine Learning thorough my master thesis and my job as a Data Analyst in Samsung Electronics. During past two years, I’ve learned many things about this subject. I’ve used many resources in my journey towards Data Science, from online courses in Edx and Coursera to listening to data related podcast and reading O’Reilly books.</p>

        <p>Here you can find a list of resources that I’ve used in this period. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hpJ2-KUdgcPqX6D6MTijA9lhuVg_Rd2jajgjlaz-dv0" title="Download"><i class="fa fa-cloud-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></p>
